# This Repository contains the models of Machine Learning Algorithms such as:
  - ## [Supervised](https://github.com/raghu826/MachineLearning/tree/master/Supervised)
    - [Regression](https://github.com/raghu826/MachineLearning/tree/master/Supervised/Regression) : Linear, Ploynomial, Logistic Regression 
    - [Classification](https://github.com/raghu826/MachineLearning/tree/master/Supervised/Classification) : Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
  - ## [UnSupervised](https://github.com/raghu826/MachineLearning/tree/master/UnSupervised)
    - Clustering Techniques : [KMeans](https://github.com/raghu826/MachineLearning/blob/master/UnSupervised/KMeansClustering.py)
    
These algorithms are implemented on the data in the `DataSets` folder. 
The main libraries used in these models are `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.

#### The model involves
  - Data preprocessing(data cleaning, deals with missing value, Encoding categorical data)
  - Data Cleaning 
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Data Visualisation
  - Spliting the data into Test set and Training set
  - Training the model and fitting the train data
  - Evalute and Predict the outcomes
  - Calculate the metrics like MAE, Accuracry score.
