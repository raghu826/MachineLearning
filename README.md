This Repository contains the models of Machine Learning Algorithms such as:
  - Supervised
          - Regression : Linear, Ploynomial, Logistic Regression 
          - Classification : Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
  - UnSupervised
          - Clustering Techniques : KMeans
These algorithms are implemented on the data in the 'DataSets' folder. 
The main libraries used in these models are Scikit-learn, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib 
 The model involves
        - Data preprocessing(data cleaning, deals with missing value, Encoding categorical data)
        - Data Visualisation
        - Spliting the data into Test set and Training set
        - Training the model and fitting the train data
        - Evalute and Predict the outcomes
        - Calculate the metrics like MAE, Accuracry score.
